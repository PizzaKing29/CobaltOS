## ‚ùìFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Question 1: Is CobaltOS Safe to use?

Yes, CobaltOS is safe to use. This project is open sourced and the code can be looked at, no malicious code is .gitignored, if you get any signs of the program being flagged for malicious content ignore it and run anyways.

### Question 2: Do I need to install anything before running CobaltOS?

If you plan on downloading the .exe you do not have to install anything to use the program

For those who want to download the .ZIP, you must have .NET 9 installed and can refer to the Download Instructions. This is for those who want to edit the code themselves or for preference.

### Question 3: Will CobaltOS work on Windows 7/8 or other linux distros?

For right now I do not have plans to implement those operating system versions, once I start getting releases and polishing this up I will consider it.

### Question 4: Why did you make this project?

I initially started this project in another repository that was made fully in powershell to help fix common issues in your computer and to help troubleshoot, this was for a friend of mine who kept on having issues with his computer and we werent able to find the root cause of the errors. I now have taken a more professional approach on this and plan to work longterm for CobaltOS.
